"""
NIPT Analysis Project
====================

A comprehensive analysis toolkit for Non-invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) data.
This project addresses four key problems related to NIPT time point selection 
and fetal abnormality detection.

Structure:
- data/: Data loading and preprocessing modules
- models/: Statistical and machine learning models
- analysis/: Problem-specific analysis modules (problem1-4)
- utils/: Utility functions for visualization, statistics, etc.
- config/: Configuration files and constants
- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis

Problems addressed:
1. Y chromosome concentration relationship with gestational age and BMI
2. BMI-based grouping for optimal NIPT timing (male fetuses)
3. Multi-factor analysis for NIPT timing optimization
4. Female fetus abnormality detection methods
