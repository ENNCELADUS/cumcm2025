## Git Workflow and Project Management

### Milestone-Based Development
- After finishing every milestone in `plan.md`, commit and push once every milestone is implemented and passes tests in `beta` branch
- Mark `[ ]` to finished (like `[x]`) when the task is finished for every milestone subtask in `plan.md`
- Use descriptive commit messages following the format: `feat: MX complete - description`
- All tests must pass before committing and pushing

### Branch Strategy
- Development work happens in `beta` branch
- Commit to `beta` after each completed milestone
- Only merge to `main` for stable releases or major completions
- Include detailed commit messages with milestone progress

### Plan.md Maintenance
- Keep `plan.md` up to date with current progress
- Mark completed tasks immediately upon completion
- Update milestone status (âœ… COMPLETED) when all subtasks are done
- Reference specific accomplishments in commit messages
